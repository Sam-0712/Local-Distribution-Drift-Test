# Local-Distribution-Drift-Test
This project demonstrates that even without neural networks, classical statistical mechanics tools can reveal the deep structural differences between human and machine text. While LLMs can mimic human macro-statistics, their underlying generation dynamics—characterized by high auto-regressive coefficients—remain distinct and detectable.
